## Medical Diagnosis System

### Introduction

This program is a simple **Medical Diagnosis System** implemented in C++, allowing users to input patient information, symptoms, and vital signs to receive a diagnosis and suggested remedies.

The system prompts the user to enter the patient's name, age, gender, body temperature, and height, followed by a list of symptoms. Based on this input, the system guesses potential diseases and suggests remedies accordingly.

The system employs a modular design, with functions for displaying menus, handling input, clearing the input buffer, displaying headers and error messages, and suggesting remedies based on guessed diseases. It utilizes vectors and maps to manage patient symptoms, guessed diseases, and suggested remedies efficiently.

Users can interact with the system through a command-line interface, providing input as requested. The program then processes the input and generates a diagnosis along with recommended remedies for the identified diseases. If no specific disease is identified, the system provides general health tips to promote well-being.

This Medical Diagnosis System serves as a basic tool for users to assess potential health issues based on symptoms and vital signs, offering guidance on possible remedies or preventative measures.
