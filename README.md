## Medical Diagnosis System

### Introduction

This program is a simple **Medical Diagnosis System** implemented using a user interface developed in C++ with the Qt framework, alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for webpage development. This system allows users to input patient information, symptoms, and vital signs to receive a diagnosis and suggested remedies.

The system prompts the user to enter the patient's name, age, gender, body temperature, and height, followed by a list of symptoms. Based on this input, the system guesses potential diseases and suggests remedies accordingly.

The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for inputting patient data and receiving diagnosis information. The use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enhances the visual presentation and interactivity of the system, making it accessible across different devices and platforms.

The system employs a modular design, with functions for displaying menus, handling input, clearing the input buffer, displaying headers and error messages, and suggesting remedies based on guessed diseases. It utilizes vectors and maps to manage patient symptoms, guessed diseases, and suggested remedies efficiently.

Users can interact with the system through the graphical user interface, providing input as requested. The program then processes the input and generates a diagnosis along with recommended remedies for the identified diseases. If no specific disease is identified, the system provides general health tips to promote well-being.

This Medical Diagnosis System serves as a basic tool for users to assess potential health issues based on symptoms and vital signs, offering guidance on possible remedies or preventative measures.

### System Components

- **C++ with Qt UI:** Provides the backend functionality and user interface for inputting patient data and receiving diagnoses.
  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Enhances the user interface, making it visually appealing and interactive for users accessing the system through a web browser.
  
- **Modular Design:** Utilizes functions for various tasks such as input handling, displaying messages, and suggesting remedies, ensuring a well-organized and maintainable codebase.

### Usage
